(1) Put index also as a column, not only as pandas index
(2) Do not put flake_id but rather the name of the original picture file
(3) Do not leave empty strings '' for blowing snow, when this info is missing. Better None?
(4) Add riming_name column in database (1: unrimed, 2: rimed, 3: densely_rimed, 4: graupel-like, 5:graupel)
